# NormalBoostedNRSfM
Code and dataset associated with the ICRA 2024 publication 'Using Specularities to Boost Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion'

In this article and this GitHub repository, we present a method to reconstruct the time-varying shape of a non-rigid/deforming surface from the following inputs:

   1. Accurate keypoint correspondences (e.g.: from feature matching from standard feature descriptors) on the deforming surface captured across multiple images (preferably more than 5 images)

   2. Sparse surface normals on the surface of the object (**optional input to the code**)
